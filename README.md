What incentive do I have to develop yet another OCR Vision AI tool when there are already thousands of options readily available in market?

The majority of the offerings in the market or available wrappers are built upon Open Source OCR packages.
In contrast, Vision AI solutions by large companies, which are not reliant on Open Source technologies, often offer low upfront costs but impose significant charges later on, frequently requiring customers to pay per image used.
Why pay for inferior results from a service not trained on your data, when building an in-house, cost-effective, on-premise solution with customized capabilities is feasible, without risking data exposure.

Here are some use cases you can consider optimizing this OCR Vision API by training it on "in-house" data.

Document classifier
Digital Invoice scanner
Digital Private signature matching
Scanning for confidential information like PHI, Private health, or Personal data
Train on "in-house" data for classifying "Secured information" in contracts, spends, etc.
Label or Hash documents
Sorting Receipts, Vendor Invoices or Matching Employee Expenses
Duplicate Invoice ....
This OCR Vision AI code below, is just one of many ways while numerous smarter optimizations are possible. and Fine tuning these models with in-house knowledge base will results into more accurate results.



OCR, Vision AI automated build process
Step 1: A receipt or invoice document is uploaded / dropped to a folder or you system takes a screenshot of an image or document

Step 2: Automated Code to call script is executed as soon as file is dropped

Step 3: Scripts read text from images

Step 4: Scripts to build prompts

Step 5: Send prompts to Llama 2 | ChatGPT

Step 6: Store results back to Application


Conclusion:
The use case discussed above exemplify sophisticated business processes and there is certainly lot more which is not covered.

This use case merely scratch the surface of what can be achieved with these advanced tools.

You may argue that the same results can be attained using simple algebraic mathematics with these datasets, and I fully support and agree with this observation.

In essence, the entire field, encompassing Data Science, Python, Llama, and ChatGPT, revolves around uncovering statistical associations within data.

However, it is crucial to recognize that the deployment of Llama or ChatGPT-like models does not surpass the importance of traditional statistics, instead, they should be employed to streamline specific tasks.
